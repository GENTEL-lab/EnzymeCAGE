```

## Running
* Download csv format dataset and alphafold2 structures of enzymes
* Run AlphaFill to get the catalytic pocket
* Prepare the feature of enzymes and reactions
* Train the model, retrieve the candidate enzymes for reactions, do inference and ranking
* Evaluate the performance of the model

### Dataset
First, download the dataset and extract it to the current directory.


#### Option 1: Directly use the extracted pockets
We have run AlphaFill and pre-extracted the enzyme pockets from the dataset, and you can directly use this part of the data to reproduce the experimental results. The pockets are located in `./dataset/pocket/alphafill_8A`

Note: To improve the running speed of AlphaFill, we set the number of homologous proteins to query to 5 (the default is 200). The corresponding parameter is `--blast-report-limit=5`

#### Option 2: Rerun AlphaFill to extract the pockets
If you need to calculate features for model training or directly perform inference on your own dataset, you will need to run AlphaFill to extract the pockets yourself.

**Step 1: Get the CIF format structure of enzymes**

If your dataset only contains protein sequences, you will first need to obtain structural information (preferably in CIF format). You can either deploy [colabfold](https://github.com/YoshitakaMo/localcolabfold.git), locally or choose to [run it online](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb)ï¼Œ

**Step 2: Deploy AlphaFill**

First, download the PDB-REDO database (this may take some time):
```shell
cd dataset/PDB-REDO
rsync -av --exclude=attic rsync://rsync.pdb-redo.eu/pdb-redo/ pdb-redo/
```

Next, download the code and deploy AlphaFill:
```shell
cd feature/pkgs
git clone https://github.com/PDB-REDO/alphafill.git
cp ../../scripts/run_alphafill ./alphafill
cd alphafill
```
Then, follow the [tutorial](https://github.com/PDB-REDO/alphafill) to set up the environment.

**Step 3: Run AlphaFill**

After setup is complete, run the script `run_alphafill.py` to execute AlphaFill and extract the pockets:
```shell
python run_alphafill.py \
    --input_dir {CIF_DIR} \ # Folder containing CIF files
    --output_dir {OUT_DIR} \ # Output folder for extracted pockets
    --pdb_fasta {FASTA_PATH} \ # Located in dataset/PDB-RED/pdbredo_seqdb.txt
    --pdb_redo_dir {PDB_REDO_DIR} \ # Located in dataset/PDB-REDO/pdb-redo/
```
